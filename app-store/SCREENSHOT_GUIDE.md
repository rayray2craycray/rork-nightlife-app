## Text Overlay Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- **Keep it short** - 3-8 words max
- **Benefit-focused** - "Earn Rewards" not "Rewards Feature"
- **Action-oriented** - Use verbs ("Discover", "Connect", "Earn")
- **High contrast** - White on dark, or dark on light
- **Readable font** - Sans-serif, 48px+ size
- **Consistent style** - Same font/colors across all screenshots

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't overcrowd** - Too much text distracts
- **Don't use jargon** - Speak plainly
- **Don't make promises** - Only show real features
- **Don't use all caps** - Looks spammy (except headings)
- **Don't block UI** - Text should enhance, not hide the app

### Example Text Overlays

**Screenshot 1 (Map):**
- Headline: "Discover Nightlife in Real-Time"
- Subtext: "See live vibes, crowds, and wait times"

**Screenshot 2 (Feed):**
- Headline: "Watch What's Happening Right Now"
- Subtext: "Real videos from real venues"

**Screenshot 3 (Challenges):**
- Headline: "Earn Rewards at Your Favorite Spots"
- Subtext: "Free drinks, skip lines, VIP access"

**Screenshot 4 (Venue):**
- Headline: "Know Before You Go"
- Subtext: "See events, photos, and live updates"

**Screenshot 5 (Tickets):**
- Headline: "Buy Tickets in Seconds"
- Subtext: "Instant QR codes, easy transfers"

**Screenshot 6 (Social):**
- Headline: "Find Your Friends"
- Subtext: "See where your crew is in real-time"

**Screenshot 7 (Profile):**
- Headline: "Track Your Nightlife Journey"
- Subtext: "Badges, streaks, and memories"
